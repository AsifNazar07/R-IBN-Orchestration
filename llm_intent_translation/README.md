# LLM-Driven Intent Translation and Orchestration Framework (DRLGNN-IBN)

This repository provides a complete implementation of a research-grade intent translation and orchestration framework based on:

- Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language intent parsing
- KNN-based contradiction detection
- BiLSTM with Attention for sequence-based classification
- Graph Neural Networks (GNN) + Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for service orchestration

This codebase reproduces the experimental results reported in our paper submitted to Elsevier Computer Networks.
